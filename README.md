# Object Tracking in Arduino

Object tracking is the process of locating and moving object or multiple objects over time. The object is detected from
the input sensor.

This is project demonstrate Object Tracking using gesture sensor in Arduino. In addition to that, you will also have a nice
Eye Display that display the movement of the object.
